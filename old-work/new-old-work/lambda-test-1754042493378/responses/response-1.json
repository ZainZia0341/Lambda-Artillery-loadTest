    "evaluation": "Your answer is incorrect - you have the programs reversed and oversimplified the eligibility criteria. Medicare is primarily for people 65 and older or those under 65 with qualifying disabilities, while Medicaid is a state-managed program for people who meet certain income thresholds or have qualifying disabilities, regardless of age. The key distinction is that Medicare eligibility is based on age (65+) or disability status, whereas Medicaid eligibility is primarily based on income level and/or disability.",
