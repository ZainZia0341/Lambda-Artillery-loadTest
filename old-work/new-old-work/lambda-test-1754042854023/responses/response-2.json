    "evaluation": "The user's answer is completely incorrect as it reverses the age-based distinctions between these programs. Medicare is actually the federal program primarily for people 65 and older (or those under 65 with qualifying disabilities), while Medicaid is a state-managed program based on income thresholds and/or disabilities, not age. The key difference is that Medicare eligibility is determined by age (65+) or disability status, whereas Medicaid eligibility is determined by income level and/or disability status.",
