    "evaluation": "The user's answer is completely incorrect. Medicare is actually for people 65 and older OR those under 65 with qualifying disabilities, while Medicaid is a state-managed program for people meeting income thresholds OR having qualifying disabilities - age is not the primary factor for Medicaid eligibility. The key distinction is that Medicare eligibility is based on age (65+) or disability status, whereas Medicaid eligibility is primarily based on income level and/or disability.",
