    "evaluation": "The user's answer is completely incorrect. Medicare is actually the federal program for people 65 and older OR those under 65 with qualifying disabilities, while Medicaid is the state-managed program for people who meet specific income thresholds OR have qualifying disabilities. The key distinction is that Medicare eligibility is based on age (65+) or disability status, whereas Medicaid eligibility is primarily based on income level and/or disability, not age categories as the user suggested.",
